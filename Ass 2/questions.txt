1. Why does inline style CSS override rules define in <style> elements and external stylesheets?
	When a browser renders a website it always read from top to bottom. Meaning it goes through the <head> before the body, and therefore sets the css-values before rendering the body. These values are then changed when the browser notices them as attributes to the HTML-elements when rendering the page.
	
2. Give a brief example of when to use ID (#id) and when to use classes (.class) in CSS.
	Only use IDs when necessary, like when you need to access just one element, like a logo or the main section.
	
	Try to always use classes, because the same code can be used for several elements. For instance when making a blog, the same code can be used for every single article.
	
3. What does RGBA mean and what colors can you express with it?
	RGBA stands for Red Green Blue Alpha. Here you can control the intensity of red, green and blue between the values of 0 to 255. If all values are 255 the color is white, and when all values are 0, the color is black. The Alpha channel is usually used for opacity, and uses the values between 0 to 1, where 0 is fully transparent and 1 is fully opaque.
	
4. Why do we include CSS files inside the <head> element and not inside the <body> element?
	Simply because we don't want the user to see the unstyled page. By having it in the head element, the CSS loads before the body starts to load. This means the browser already knows how to style the HTML, and the user has a smoother experience.
	
5. What CSS selector matches all the p elements inside the article element in the following HTML?
	article p or article > p should do the trick. With ">" you target all the p elements where article is a parent, while without ">" you target all p elements within the article element.
