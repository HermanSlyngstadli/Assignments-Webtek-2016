1. Why does the following expression 0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 evaluate to false in Javascript?
	Javascript stores numbers in floating points, which means that every number is an integer multiplied by an exponent of two (p*2^q). Summarized this means that some numbers are only approximated, though normally the an irrelevant difference, it makes 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.30000000000000004 and not 0.3.


2. What does the method attribute on a form element decide?
	The method attribute decides what type of http method should be used by the browser to submit the form. Either the GET or POST method.


3. Explain why the form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is changed to GET?
	The GET method sends all its data through the request-URI. So by definition it has to go in the URL. Sperated from the hierarchical part of the URL with a ?, the server receiving the data can then deconstruct the query and get the values.


4. Why is it considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 and/or Javascript?
	HTML5 is supported by all modern browser, but outdated versions and other browsers are not supported. 

	Concerning js, there is always the possibility that the user interfers with the script intentionally or unintentionally. There is also the possibility of bots or bad people stealing the information. 

	You should always validate server side, but use HTML5 and js to enhance the user experience.


5.When is it appropriate to use textarea over input?
	When you want a multi-line input. Input[type="text"] and others removes all line breaks.
