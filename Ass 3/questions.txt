What is the difference between position: absolute and position: fixed?
	Absolute is positioning relative to the document (or parent), and fixed is relative to the window (like tape on your screen).

With CSS3, how do we access the third element within another element?
	parent :nth-child(3). This selects the third child of the parent. (The space is really important)
